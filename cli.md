# CLI

Standart practice and some tips

## Arguments

Argument for control logs verbose level -v -vv -vvv, ... etc.

Example in Ansible

```sh
 -v, --verbose         Causes Ansible to print more debug messages. Adding multiple -v will increase the
                        verbosity, the builtin plugins currently evaluate up to -vvvvvv. A reasonable
                        level to start is -vvv, connection debugging might require -vvvv.
```
